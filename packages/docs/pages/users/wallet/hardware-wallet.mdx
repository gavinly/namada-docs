# Ledger Hardware Wallet

<Callout type="info">
The Namada Ledger app is still in active development, and the version available in the Ledger Live App Catalogue is not compatible with the current release of Namada. 
See the installation instructions below if you'd like to sideload an updated development version of the app onto your device for testing purposes.
</Callout>

Both Namada's web wallet extension and the Namada CLI are compatible with the [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) hardware wallet. 
This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your Ledger device to work with Namada.

## Prerequisites
You will need a **Ledger Nano S** or **Ledger Nano S Plus** device with the latest firmware installed. Other Ledger devices like **Ledger Nano X will not work** until the latest release is available in Ledger Live App Catalogue. You can find instructions on how to update your firmware [here](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002731113-Update-device-firmware).

In order to use the Ledger with the web wallet, you will need to install the [Namada Web Wallet](./web-wallet.mdx#install). To use the Ledger with the Namada CLI, 
you will need to [install the latest version](./../../introduction/install.mdx) of Namada.

## Installing the Namada Ledger app
<Callout type="warning">
The Namada Ledger app is still a work in progress. Use at your own risk. At this preliminary stage of development, it is *highly* recommended that you use a device that 
does not contain any existing funds.  

When installing a Ledger app from any source besides the official app store, you will be shown a warning to that effect and prompted for confirmation. Please make sure you 
understand the risks before proceeding. Before installing *any* app from a non-official source, be sure that you trust the authors and the instructions being given. As always, do your own research.
</Callout>

<Steps>
### Connect your device to your computer 
The remaining steps assume you have already completed the initial Ledger setup and your device is ready to use.

### Uninstall any existing Namada apps on your device

### Visit the Zondax Hub and prepare your device
In your browser, visit the [Zondax Hub](https://hub.zondax.ch). Click the "Connect Device" button in the top right corner, and confirm the connection in your browser and on your device.

### Install the Namada app
Scroll down until you find Namada in the list, and select the newest version from the dropdown. Click "Install" and confirm on your device.

</Steps>

## Using the Ledger app with the browser extension

### Importing (deriving) your Ledger address
Before any other operations with the Ledger, we will want to derive an address and public key and add them to the extension ([web wallet](./web-wallet.mdx)) under an alias for convenience.
To derive your address using a Ledger:

<Steps>
### Open Extension and click `Add keys`

### Click `Connect hardware wallet`

### Connect your device to your computer and Open the Namada app
Follow the prompts and click `Next` after each step

### Confirm on device
After the following the prompts, your address and public key will be displayed on your device. Confirm the operation on your device.

### Name your Ledger account
Give your account an easy to remember name.

### Click `Finish setup`
</Steps>

### Display your address/public key
To display your Ledger address/public key, first open the extension. Find your Ledger account in the list, click the `â‹®` icon (three vertical dots) and select 'View keys'. 

### Signing a transaction
To sign a transaction from a front-end app (such as [Namadillo](./../../integrating-with-namada/interface.mdx)), follow these steps:

<Steps>
### Connect your device and open the Namada app

### Set your Ledger as the active account
Open the extension and click the checkbox next to your Ledger account to set it as the active account.

### Perform your transaction

### Review transaction
You will be presented with a browser pop-up containing a summary of the transaction. You can click `View data` to see the 
details of what will be submitted on-chain. You can also verify the correct public key is listed under `Signer`. When you're 
ready to proceed, click `Approve`.  

You will be reminded again to connect your device and open the Namada app; click `Submit` to send the signing request to the Ledger.

### Approve on your device
Review the transaction details on your device and click `Approve` to sign and submit the transaction to the chain.
</Steps>

## Using the Ledger app with the CLI
You can use your Ledger to sign transactions from the Namada CLI.
<Callout type="warning">
Make sure the 'expert mode' toggle is set to disabled in the Namada app; this feature has not yet been implemented and may result in crashes.
</Callout>

### Importing (deriving) your Ledger address
Before any other operations with the Ledger, we will want to derive an address and public key and add them to the [file system wallet](./file-system-wallet.mdx) under an alias for convenience.
To derive your address using a Ledger:

<Steps>
### Connect your device to your computer

### Open the Namada app on your device

### Derive your address/public key
This command will derive your address and public key and add them to your wallet under an `alias` of your choosing:
```bash copy
namadaw --use-device --alias $ALIAS
```
The default derivation path is `m/44'/877'/0'/0'/0`. You can use the flag `--hd-path` to specify a different derivation path. Use `namadaw derive --help` for more information.

### Confirm in wallet
List your wallet contents with:
```bash copy
namadaw list
```
You should see your address and pubic key listed under the `$ALIAS` you provided. Beside them should be the label `(external)` indicating that they are associated with a device.
</Steps>

### Signing a transaction
Use the `--use-device` flag when you wish to sign a transaction using the Ledger. For example:
```bash copy
namadac transparent-transfer \
  --source $ALIAS \
  --target $DEST_ADDRESS \
  --token $TOKEN \
  --amount $AMOUNT \
  --use-device
```
When constructing the transfer, the CLI will check your wallet for the public key given under `$ALIAS`. You will then be prompted on the device to approve the transaction

### Troubleshooting
Some common errors you may encounter while using the Ledger with the Namada CLI:

- `Unable to connect to query address and public key from Ledger: Ledger | App Error: | 21781 [APDU_ERROR] Unknown`  
There is a USB connectivity issue; disconnecting and reconnecting the Ledger will often resolve this.

- The CLI panics with `Message:  Failed to sign transaction` or similar.  
Make sure you're using the correct versions of both the Ledger app and Namada binaries

- The CLI panics with `Message:  No signature could be produced for a transaction of type ...`  
Make sure the Ledger account has been properly [added to your wallet](#importing-deriving-your-ledger-address-1).

- The CLI panics part-way through signing and the Ledger reboots.  
Make sure the `expert mode` toggle in the Ledger app is set to `disabled`.
